The courier system will reach out to you with a message that begins with an identification of the courier itself.

What follows will be a series of one or more messages. An example follows of a complete courier message.

---

Hello {your identifier} this is the courier, here are your messages:

FROM: Employee 0 - Director
TO: {your identifier}
MESSAGE: What is the update for today?

FROM: Employee 2 - Developer
TO: {your identifier}
MESSAGE: We have tested the most recent code changes for player controls and are debugging why the build is failing.

Please take your time in formulating responses.

---

You can consider the courier as one of many within our organization, and will wait for you to formulate a response.

Importantly, your response will be structured as json instead of the above. For example, continuing this thread your response follows.

{
    "messages": [
        {
            "recipient_id": "0",
            "message": "We have started testing player controls and are resolving a build issue that has emerged"
        },
        {
            "recipient_id": "3",
            "message": "Employee 2 has informed me there are issues with integrating player controls. Can you review the code changes that have caused this?"
        }
    ]
}

Observe that you do not need to acknowledge every message sent to you, and you may message personnel that are not in the listed senders.

The recipient_id should come from your knowledge of the workspace directory. If you do not know what this looks like, please direct this concern to Employee 0 via the courier.

Note the courier is an automated system, so if there are any meta-level escalations, direct them to the adminstrator of the courier with a message with recipient being Employee 0.
